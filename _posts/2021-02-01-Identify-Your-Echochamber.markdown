After 4 years, I have started using Social Media platforms again. While I had no difficulties posting (except stories on Instagram), there are certain observations and patterns that I have started to come across different social media platforms. Detailing them out here : 

1. **Twitter :** Tagline from a user's perspective : I am smart and "intellectual" as well. Please koi 
    meri bhi sun lo. 
    
    From replying on Elon Musk's and Balajis Tweets to posting random threads on why you should 
    switch to Signal, Twitter is an echo - chamber of wanna be "intellectuals". While Twitter does 
    help one get deep insights into any topic from some of the most credible individuals, it is also 
    an echo - chamber of people who are "faking" it till they make it. There's nothing right/wrong in 
    this. Well, who doesn't like to have a million followers! But what I'll really appreciate is a   
    following built on one's substance, skills and not copy pasted Tweets, or networking.

2. **Instagram**  **:** Tagline from a user's perspective : I can post, apply filters, travel to Thailand and 
    Dubai. Mein bhi fake Picasso. 

    Scrolling through some of the posts on Instagram is a sheer delight as it is one of the biggest 
    echo chambers. Same is the case with Facebook. A snapshot of the post :

I would appreciate if people can bring some innovation to their replies and not copy/paste "great" or "wow". 

**Leave the Table**

If you are the smartest individual and get validated from others all the time, you are doing more harm than good to yourself. It is time to leave the table and join a new one when you stop getting pushback from your inner circle/ community. You are just fooling yourself and hiding your insecurities otherwise.

To be a philosophical king, one needs to become a king first. So, moving forward, I'll avoid posting generic stuff unless I am really tempted to. 

P.S. : Forgive me for my drawing skills. It is one of the OKRs for this year and I am treating it as a [product](https://23ruchil.github.io/Blog/2021/02/01/Everything-Is-A-Product.html)
