I've stayed in Delhi - NCR for ~ 1.5 years now (since September 2019) and came back to Delhi after 14 years (after 2005). Now that I look back, there are certain observations that worry me about Delhi - Gurgaon culture. Listing them down here : 

1.  Overt celebration of **eat-sleep-repeat** culture : The common phrase that I hear most people 
    use is : " I don't want to think too much and just chill". While it is perfectly fine to do so, you 
    have lost the right to complain about your problems. Every third person here has an opinion on
    some of the most pressing issues such as education, poverty and pollution, but what are 
    we doing about it. These issues will not be solved by **eat-sleep-repeat** culture. Put in 
    the effort to first form an opinion and do your bit towards solving the problem. If you are not 
    doing so, please stop complaining. If you think there are no problems at all, refer to this [link](https://www.delhi.gov.in). 
    You will need to put in the effort to find quite a few of them. 

2. **Forming World views through Bollywood movies and TV shows such as Friends** : Guys, 
    while I agree that some of these shows and movies are a delight to watch, doesn't mean that 
    you expect the same things to happen in your life. One needs to have the lens of objectivity on 
    while watching this show. It is a script written by a professional 
    whose end goal is to either increase the TRP or sales of subscription. 
    Bollywood is one of the biggest ceilings of this country IMO.  More on this [here](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1350065743035985922) . I recently read 
    a quote that said, "Let me make the songs of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws". Song 
    writers are writing their doing their job, we need to do ours. This [book](https://www.amazon.in/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X) might come  handy if 
   you want to dig deeper into this topic. 

3. **Fluff over substance :** Most folks that I've met have come across as extremely pretentious 
    and unauthentic. North Star for such people is to play the status game while forgetting that 
    they do not have substance. You can only go so far with "fake it till you make it" attitude. Self - 
    awareness as a trait is limited in supply in this part of this country .

With that being said, there are some beautiful things about Delhi such as food which I will miss. The above pointers are based on my personal experiences and opinions of some of my close friends. You may choose to disagree and form your opinion/experiences. 

P.S. :  I do not wish to come back to Delhi unless I'm forced to.
