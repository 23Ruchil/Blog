Title How to build effective habits? 

Habit formation is more science than art. It requires constant re-evaluation of where you are spending time, your calendar and even your priorities. Last year, I spent significant time researching this and stumbled upon different books and blog posts that have proven to be really helpful in planning my day and subsequently, my week. This blog post is to detail out a couple of them. 

1. **Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg**

  Prof. B.J. Fogg is the founder of the Behaviour Design Lab at Stanford University and teaches industry 
  Innovators how behaviour really works. Kevin Systrom (founder of Instagram) was one of BJ Fogg’s 
  students and habit formation is one of core elements of Instagram (stories bein one of them). 

  According to BJ Fogg,any behaviour can be broken down into three things : 

  1. Motivation 
  2. Ability 
  3. Prompt 

Motivation :  While one should not rely on motivation (as it is high during the day and goes down in the 
evening) focussing on ability and prompt is relatively easier.  
 
Ability : Make the action so tiny that your ability to do it increases significantly. Want to lose 10Kgs in 1 month? Just visit the gym and come out for the first three days. Want to start your own blog? Great, open any notepad And start jotting down your thoughts. We overestimate what we can achieve in the short run and underestimate what we can in the long run. Consistency >>> Magnitude of work done

Prompt : This is the easiest to manage among all three. Your environment speaks volumes about how serious you are about getting the job done.Designing the environment that is conducive to successful completion of a behaviour is often underestimated. A few examples would be setting up the alarm to go for a run, turning off social media notifications (prompt removal) while studying.

**Other hacks**

* Habit Chain** : Any of the following factors can act as a friction to form habits successfully : 

Time 
Money 
Physical Effort 
Mental Effort 
Routine 

* Pinpoint the exact route cause and try to fix it. 

* Fear and self - doubt decreases the likelihood of habit formation whereas hope increases the same. 

* What matters while building new habits? 

Mindset 
Behaviour crafting 
Self - Insight 
Process 
Context 

Last, but not the least, the entire framework for forming habits: 

1. Clarify the aspiration 

Be very specific while defining your habits. Don’t use vague statements such as I want to lose weight or score more marks or get X followers. Have a strong bias towards action and make it specific. 

One example : I want to read 70+ books by the end of this year

2. Explore Behaviour Options : Explore what behaviours can you add/remove from your daily lifestyle such 
    to increase the likelihood of new habit formation. 

3. Match with specific behaviours 

    Add specific actions before or after anchor habits. 

   Example : After having dinner, I will listen to one podcast. 

4. Start Tiny 

   Make the starting point so small so that it is extremely easy to execute. (Increasing the ability) 

5. Find a Good Prompt 

6. Celebrate Successes

    Have your own ways to celebrate success upon completing desirable behaviours. Reward yourself in 
    Private or publicly. 

7. Troubleshoot, Iterate and Expand 

    Experiment and iterate constantly what works/doesn’t work for you. 


2. **Atomic Habits by James Clear** 

The framework suggested by James Clear is as follows:  

1. Make the habit an obvious thing to do 
2. Make it attractive 
3. Make it easy (by increasing the ability) 
4. Make it satisfying : By enjoying the process and celebrating after the successful completion of the 
    desirable behaviour.

**Other Hacks** : 

**Batching** : Club similar habits together to get things done. One example could be listening to podcasts while going for a walk. 

**Embracing Boredom** : It takes a long time to successfully build and sustain new habits, so embrace boredom. 

**Process over Outcomes** : Focus on completing the habit rather than achieving the goal. Compounding happens after the end of compounding.

**Role of friends and family** : Choose your peers wisely. Peers that will contribute towards the successful change in habits. Everything else is secondary. 

**Change the content of self - talk** : If you want to read more, do not tell yourself : “I want to read more; instead say I am a reader”. Personality change >>>> Action 

One of the goals that I have this year is to get at least one blog post out each week using the above framework. If you find my posts interesting, get in touch with me at ruchil.product@gmail.com
