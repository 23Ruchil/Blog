title:  "Getting Your Time Back"
---

A few things that I have started doing to get back my time: 

* Setting an agenda for the meeting with the meeting invite. Agenda less meetings create confusion and 
  lead to people talking about random things. 
* 30 mins meeting by default as a calendar invite. This has helped me to close the open points quickly to 
  free up time for important things.
* Putting slots on my calendar when I want to get work done without any distraction. I cancel/
  reschedule all meetings if they clash during that time.
* Ending meetings early or declining to attend those that do not provide any insight/actionable. I also 
  make sure that one of the attendees or I share the actionables from a meeting with all the relevant    stakeholders within 24 hours of the meeting.
* Not attending calls/meetings just because they are on my calendar.
* While talking feedback and ideas from relevant stakeholders is important, executing low impact ideas may
  not be the best use of your time. To avoid this, I try to make the person who proposes an idea think. You  can refer to [this][jekyll-productivity] template for more information 
* End meetings early if you are done discussing the action items. No point extending the meeting for an 
  hour just because the calendar invite was for one hour. 
* You may wish to choose Eisenhower matrix to prioritise your work. Refer to the image below:
