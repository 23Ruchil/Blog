Not that I have cut down on my side gigs or changed my priorities, but a simple addition of an age old technique called Pomodoro has changed the way I have started to think about time. Here’s how I see the difference :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Old Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me list down what I am supposed to do today and complete today’s To - Dos. I’ll go through the list one by one and then reward myself at the end of the day with an episode of “House of Lies” or reply to some of my Whatsapp messages. But there is something inherently evil with this strategy which is “not defining your stop losses”. As soon as I find my flow in one of  the activities in  my To - Do list, I lose track of time and can only complete ~ 50% of the assigned tasks on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining the activities on and outside my To - Do list as Pomodoros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grocery Shopping - 1 Pomodoro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading Books - 5 Pomodoros&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a chat with my family : 1 Pomodoro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Office Work : 22 Pomodoros&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interacting with my family and friends over the weekend : 2 Pomodoros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only has thinking in Pomodoros made me more productive, but also helped me do a lot more work in a lot less time. The reason for this is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25 mins of focussed attention that makes me much more productive as compared to dragging things for 
 hours with decreasing productivity. This leads to nothing, but an increased production of Adenosine in my body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doing more activities and putting a hard stop to a particular activity after completing the assigned 
Pomodoros.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taking 7 minute breaks in which I practice playing Harmonica (Well, it makes me feel relaxed and
obsess over my Harmonica tunes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Increasing number of users are spending their time online and using social media tools to express themselves. Amidst this, can the activities (posts/likes/comments) performed by people on social media be used to hire candidates for different job profiles? I see this as a great way to differentiate candidates from others in cases where they have similar educational backgrounds, skill sets, and resumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put ourselves out there whenever we post something, like/comment on a post, or update our Goodreads account with the latest book that we’ve read. Every activity that we perform online conveys some or the other aspect about us. I feel that the reliance on social media to filter applicants will increase with time and will be used to differentiate similar candidates, especially to determine cultural fit (something on the lines of Klout Score, but more focussed towards determining cultural fit instead of influence) . Not limiting to jobs, activities on social media will also be used to filter university applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, some of the platforms and parameters that these institutions(universities, corporate firms, insurance companies, etc.) will use to determine the quality of the candidates are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GoodReads : Number of books, subject/discipline the candidate is interest in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter : Tweets posted by the user, relevance of the Tweets to the job, relevance of the people 
          followed by the applicant to the job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LinkedIn : Frequency of articles posted by the users, relevance of the post to the job, relevance of 
         the people followed by the applicant to the job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instagram : Pages liked, relevance of the people followed by the applicant to the job, relevance of pictures posted by the 
            applicant to know his/her interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially during these unprecedented times, when jobs for some of the major sectors have disappeared and when most of us are liking those cat videos, differentiating yourself and posting stuff relevant to your professional interests might come handy for securing your dream job in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, keep posting!&lt;/p&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
