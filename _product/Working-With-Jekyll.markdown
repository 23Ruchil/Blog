Not only has thinking in Pomodoros made me more productive, but also helped me do a lot more work in a lot less time. The reason for this is as follows: 

*1.25 mins of focussed attention that makes me much more productive as compared to dragging things for hours with 
  decreasing productivity. This leads to nothing, but an increased production of Adenosine in my body. 
*2.Doing more activities and putting a hard stop to a particular activity after completing the assigned Pomodoros.
*3.Taking 7 minute breaks in which I practice playing Harmonica (Well, it makes me feel relaxed and obsess over some of my   
  tunes.
